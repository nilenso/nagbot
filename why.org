Deepa spends a lot of time asking people to
- fill in their timesheets
- volunteer to review applicant code submission
- volunteer for sales conversations

This job is boring. And time taking. And a waste of Deepa's time.

The idea is to make a bot do this work.

Bot should:
- be able to poke someone about a given thing, until the person says it is done
- ensure people for a particular project have filled in their timesheets before telling Deepa the invoice is ready to send
  - this ^ is prolly a subset of the generic nagging feature
- know all the applicants waiting for reivew on code submission, ask people if they're free, willing to do this work, and then allocate it to them.
  - if not, it should ask someone else.
  - and then, it should follow up and find out if the work was done.
  - and if necessary, re-delegate
- do the same thing as above for sales work
